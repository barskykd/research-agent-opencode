# Web Search Agent

Deep web search for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) (v1 & v2). Requests up to 30 search results across several engines and fetches up to 20 pages per query — more depth than the typical 10-20 result limit of built-in tools — and delivers a one-line report pointer into an indexed report file you can read or grep.

## Why use it

Most LLM search tools return 10-20 results, limiting research depth on complex questions. This tool digs deeper — more sources, smarter extraction, quality filtering, better answers. Works with any LLM through OpenCode.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itohnobue/research-agent-opencode
cp -R research-agent-opencode/.opencode /path/to/your/project/
cp research-agent-opencode/AGENTS.md /path/to/your/project/
cp research-agent-opencode/opencode.json /path/to/your/project/   # skip if you already have one
```

If you already have an `AGENTS.md` or `opencode.json`, keep your own (append this AGENTS.md's instructions) instead of overwriting. This teaches OpenCode to route all web searches through this tool. Test it: *"Search for the most performant Rust web frameworks"*

## Key features

- **Up to 30 requested results / 20 pages per query** (40 pages with the optional DeepSeek backend) via DuckDuckGo and its multi-engine backend
- **Anti-bot bypass** — Scrapling with TLS fingerprinting, auto-fallback to httpx
- **Smart extraction** — Trafilatura content-area detection (article body, not sidebars)
- **Quality filters** — content-farm/syndication detection (F5), recency filtering on time-sensitive queries (F7), stub-page drop, cross-page deduplication
- **Non-English support** — auto-detects Japanese, Chinese, Korean and sets the appropriate DDG region
- **Wayback Machine fallback** for paywalled pages
- **PDF links, on demand** — search mode lists PDF results in a `PDF LINKS` block instead of downloading them (their transfer dominates a run); `--url <link>` downloads and extracts one via pdftotext, with a built-in pure-Python fallback (no poppler required)
- **Structured sources** — RSS/Atom feeds return dated entry lists with entry URLs; Hacker News item pages return the comment thread; peer-reviewed links resolve to open-access full text (Europe PMC, OpenAlex, arXiv)
- **Page image URLs in the report** — a page with images carries one `[images] …` line under its `=== <url> ===` header (`og:image`, then `twitter:image`, then the `<img>` attributes), so a picture can be taken straight from a result
- **Wall-clock watchdog** — hard timeout kills hung fetches on all platforms

### Supported sources

| Source | What it provides | Best for |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| DuckDuckGo (multi-engine backend) | General web index, 30 requested results / 20 fetched pages per query | General questions and any topic without a specialist source |
| Hacker News | Tech community discussion, Show HN posts, launch threads | Software releases, developer opinion, startup news |
| Stack Overflow | Programming Q&A, accepted answers, error diagnostics | Language and library specifics, bug fixes |
| Dev.to | Developer blog posts and tutorials | Practical walkthroughs, practitioner experience |
| GitHub | Repositories, issues, release notes, source code | Implementation detail, project status, version facts |
| arXiv | Preprints in CS, physics, math, engineering | Research-level technical questions before peer review |
| OpenAlex | Scholarly works, authors, open-access links | Literature discovery, citation context |
| PubMed | Biomedical and clinical literature | Medicine, clinical trials, health evidence |
| Europe PMC | Biomedical abstracts and open-access full text | Clinical evidence with retrievable full text |
| Semantic Scholar | Citation records, citers and references | Citation fallback when another index lacks the paper |
| Wayback Machine | Archived copies of pages that are gone or paywalled | Dead links, changed pages, paywalled articles |
| DeepSeek (optional) | Separate in-house search index | Extra coverage when the default backend is thin |

### Optional: DeepSeek Search

Adds DeepSeek's in-house search index alongside DuckDuckGo — 20 extra pages per query, or 40 when DuckDuckGo is unavailable. Every request asks DeepSeek for the page content too, so those pages are written into the report from the API response and are **not fetched by this machine**; DuckDuckGo results are fetched as usual. A DeepSeek result whose content is missing or unusable falls back to the local fetcher — except a PDF, which is never downloaded: it stays in `PDF LINKS`, and also becomes a report page when DeepSeek returned its content.

Off by default. Turn it on in your shell:

```bash
export WEB_RESEARCH_DEEPSEEK=1
```

The API key is read from `provider.deepseek.options.apiKey` in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — the config OpenCode already uses; `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` overrides it. Without a key the toggle prints one warning and the run continues on DuckDuckGo. `need_content` is billed exactly like a plain search request (per request, not per page), but the response takes longer to produce.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (managed by `uv`; downloaded into uv's cache if needed)
- `pdftotext` (optional — from [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/); used when present for layout-aware PDF text. Without it, a bundled pure-Python extractor handles text PDFs — scanned pages and encrypted files still yield nothing)
